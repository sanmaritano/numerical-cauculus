# numerical-cauculus
Some codes I wrote when I was studying numerical calculus on my degree. I'll try to update weekly.

>>> Octuber 13, 2021
    + I'm having major issues applying classes and importing modules, tried to create a folder
    with some numerical errors methods to compare my researches, but for some reason, even creating __init__.py file, my pip is no capable to reach my module package, so I created a file to import NumericalErrors class.

    + Also, i'm trying to create a type_input for numerical integration, to input any equation without get from integral_methods.py.

    + I'll commit the oldest version on github to a secondary branch, and push this one to main commit.
